## What is included
- Backend: Express.js + Sequelize (models, auth, basic routes)
- Database: MySQL schema (database/schema.sql)
- Frontend: React.js minimal pages (Login, Signup, StoreList)
- Validations: Server-side with express-validator, client-side checks

## How to run (locally)
1. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill DB credentials.
2. Backend:
   - cd backend
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
3. Frontend:
   - cd frontend

## Notes

- For full features (sorting, admin filters, owner dashboard details) implement UI tables and additional endpoints.
